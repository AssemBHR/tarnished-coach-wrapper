# Tarnished Coach – Public Wrapper (Demo)

This repository contains a minimal, non-functional example structure of the
offline Elden Ring AI coach (“Tarnished Coach”).

⚠️ This repository does *not* include:
- the real Modelfile
- the tuned system prompt
- the install scripts
- the gameplay logic
- the Elden Ring datasets
- the production files used in the paid version

Those are part of the commercial release.

## Purpose of this Repo

Some gaming communities prefer transparency before downloading anything from
a stranger.  
This public wrapper allows you to inspect the general structure and verify that
the project relies on **Ollama’s standard local model workflow.**

It is safe, small, and contains:
- a placeholder `Modelfile.example`
- a sample folder structure
- example usage text snippets

This wrapper is for **inspection only**.

## What the Full Version Includes (Paid)

- Fully offline Elden Ring coach (no cloud, no data collection)
- Optimized build logic for weapons, bosses, spells, and DLC
- Spoiler prevention layer
- Custom Elden Ring ruleset and skill weighting
- Enhanced reasoning tuned for boss strategies
- Windows/Mac/Linux install scripts
- Lifetime updates

---

## Why Offline?

Players wanted a tool that:
- works without internet  
- doesn’t leak builds or play habits  
- runs purely on local hardware  
- gives advice like a veteran co-op partner
